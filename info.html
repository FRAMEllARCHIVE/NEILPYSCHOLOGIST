          <p data-aos="fade-right">Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) involves the use of prescribed doses of ketamine as an adjunct to psychotherapy. KAP has shown significant potential in treating mental disorders such as treatment-resistant depression (TRD), anxiety, obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorders (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and other conditions. It can also be used for those experiencing substance abuse and physical pain.</p>

        <p data-aos="fade-right">I also offer online consultations: Although face-to-face therapy is recommended as the preferred method, online therapy might suit some people more, especially those who feel anxious about starting therapy, or those who live far away from my practice. (For instance people living in other cities or abroad.) If this is preferred, I will send you a link so that we can consult over video link online.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 data-aos="fade-left">What is Therapy and Counselling?</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-right">It sounds too easy, but simply talking to someone within a confidential and safe space allows you the freedom to open up about your feelings, the challenges you are facing, and to express yourself openly and honestly. Empathic and sincere listening by an experienced therapist who is able to use their skills, training and knowledge to help you make sense of what you are going through, can provide you with a deeper sense of clarity and awareness. With a little effort, this can deepen and enhance your coping skills.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 data-aos="fade-left">Does therapy or counselling help?</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-right">These talking interventions and behavioural techniques are evidence-based and have been shown to be very effective in treating anxiety, depression, fear, addiction and a vast range of other emotional challenges. The insights and knowledge acquired can be used to make positive changes in the way we think, feel and behave, which can in turn improve our interpersonal relationships.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 data-aos="fade-left">How do I know if I need counselling?</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-right">In actual fact we would all benefit from counselling as it can be a very life-enriching experience. Questions you may want to ask yourself however are:</p>
          <ul data-aos="fade-right">
            <li>Do I find it difficult to stay focused?</li>
            <li>Do I have difficulty sleeping through the night?</li>
            <li>Do I sometimes look in the mirror and not like what I see?</li>
            <li>Do I doubt myself at work or in my relationships?</li>
            <li>Do I worry a lot about things I can't really control?</li>
            <li>Do I drink alcohol or use drugs or medication to help me cope?</li>
            <li>Do I find myself preoccupied with the future or the past?</li>
            <li>Do I sometimes feel stressed and even overwhelmed about stuff?</li>
            <li>Do I sometimes snap and lose my temper inappropriately?</li>
            <li>Do I sometimes feel sad or want to cry for no particular reason?</li>
            <li>Do I get into lots of arguments with people who are close to me?</li>
            <li>Do I sometimes feel as if things are kind of meaningless?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 data-aos="fade-left">How many sessions will I need?</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-right">This depends on the particular circumstances of each person. We will work together to help solve some of your challenges. We will do this in the most efficient way we can, and during the first session, we will co-create a therapeutic contract and agree on a certain number of preliminary sessions. Typically however, you can expect anything from three to six sessions, but it could be more or it might be less.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 data-aos="fade-left">How much does it cost?</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-right">Psychotherapy and counselling consultations are covered by most Medical Aid schemes (obviously depending on your particular policy). I am registered with most Medical Aids and if you have the appropriate cover, I am happy to claim on your behalf. Fees are charged according to tariffs recommended by the Board of Health Care Funders. If you would prefer to pay for the consultation yourself, I usually charge R1350 for a consultation, which is less than the standard Medical Aid rates. (I accept various payment methods including cash, credit and debit cards, EFT, Zapper and even PayPal). If you would like to claim from your Medical Aid however, I will provide you with a receipt for possible reimbursement. I will make every effort to ensure you are able to afford the care you need.</p>
